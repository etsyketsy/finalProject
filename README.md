# eSkin
##This web application is meant for coding beginners and was built as my final project during my bootcamp at https://propulsion.academy/full-stack

I started to learn programming with online courses like Codeacademy. I couldn't find any applications where I could save my code snippets, add my own comments and also run/test the code at the same place. That is what I tried to do.

## How does it work?

After logging in, the user can create new notes via a button on the sidebar. He will be redirected to a page with a split screen in 4 parts.

- Bottom left - Console: Here the user can write code
- Bottom right - Output: By clicking on run, the user will see the result of his code in this window
- Top left - Snippet: The code from the console can be saved to the snippet window, which is read only.
- Top right - Comment: The user can add his own comments and use Markdown to do it.

## Syntax highlighting

- JavaScript
- Python
- HTML
- CSS

## Technology

- DevOps: Docker, Gitlab, CI/CD, Nginx
- Backend: Python, Django REST Framework, Postgres (API: https://snippetnotes.propulsion-learn.ch/backend/docs/)
- Frontend: HTML, SCSS, JavaScript, React, Redux
- Plugins: React-sortable-tree, Codemirror, React Mde, Console-feed

## Special feature

In case the user needs a break, he can play a round of Snake accessible on the home page :)
